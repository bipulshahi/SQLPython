Yes, window functions in SQL are essentially the same as the analytical functions provided above. They allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, which return a single result for each group of rows, window functions return a value for each row in the table.
Key Characteristics of Window Functions

    Over Clause: Window functions use the OVER clause, which defines the window (set of rows) to perform the calculations.
    Non-Aggregating Nature: Unlike aggregate functions, which aggregate data into a single result, window functions do not collapse the result set. Each row retains its identity.
    Flexible Partitioning and Ordering: The PARTITION BY clause divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. The ORDER BY clause defines the order of rows within each partition.

Types of Window Functions

    Ranking Functions: These include RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER(), which provide ranks to rows within the partition of a result set.
    Aggregate Window Functions: Functions like AVG(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), which can be used as window functions with the OVER clause.
    Value Functions: These include LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE(), which provide access to other rows from the current row.
